# Flash Chat ⚡️

This a group chatting app which is built using Flutter.This app has four screens a Welcome screen, Login Screen, Register Screen 
and the Chat Screen.For Backend Firebase is used. Some screenshots of the app is shown below. When the users are Logged-in or Signing-up 
for the first time they are taken to a group chat screen where all the users can chat. This app also has a authentication setup where 
new users cannot login(but they can sign up) or already logged-in user cannot register.I have used Firebase Cloud Firestore as well 
as the Firebase authentication package to equip the app with a cloud-based NoSQL database and secure authentication methods.
